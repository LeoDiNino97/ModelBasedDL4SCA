# Model based deep learning for successive convex approximation 

The purpose of this project is to apply techniques coming from model based deep learning (algorithm unrolling, proximality learning, neural augmentation...) to the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) framework. 
The aim is to define a general framework for nonconvex optimization, which spreads in many different problems in machine larning and signal processing. 

We start from some motivating examples, like nonconvex variations of the LASSO and matrix factorizations, moving towards more complex problems, like neural network training or optimization problems arising in goal-oriented communications.
